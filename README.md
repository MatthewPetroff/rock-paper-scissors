### Summary

Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game runs in the web browser.

Sequence of play:
1. User chooses rock, paper, or scissors by clicking on the corresponding image.
2. The computer randomly chooses rock, paper, or scissors.
3. The browser is updated to reflect the player choice, computer choice, and updated score.

This project really pushed me to write refined, clean JavaScript.
